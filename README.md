## Why No Source Code?

The decision to withhold the source code stems from the nature of Roblox game development. Open sourcing a Roblox game can inadvertently expose it to potential theft and server-side exploitation, compromising the game's integrity and player experience.

My priority is to maintain a secure and enjoyable environment for all players, and thus, I've opted to keep the code private. This README aims to provide a clear understanding of the project's scope, objectives, and my personal contributions.
